# TODO

- Use Case 1 to build modifications
- Have to work on log-log scale (Skip normalization for now)
- Figure out how to re-scale parameters after training
- Figure out how to sample uniformly on log-time scale


# Normalization and log (?!)
- If time is normalized, I don't have to put it in log-scale (benefit)
- If I don't normalize time, we don't get double curves :(


## Step 1: Normalize
## Step 2: Solve the problem in loglog scale
