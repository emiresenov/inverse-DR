# TODO


- Are big parameter values an issue in inverse mode? For example, if all parameters are in the thousands, will starting at e.g. 1 cause very slow convergence? 



# Finished

- ~~Are the two nonlinearities on loglog scale unique, or are there approximate solutions?~~ On loglog scale, the system is very sensitive to changes in parameter values. The system should be solvable without major complications from an ML/optimization perspective
