- Figure out how to scale time (shouldn't be too difficult) and PDE terms (seems tricky, need to preserve parameter values or rescale them post-training).
- Figure out why scatterplot on loglog scale cases issues.
- For less error-proneness, read voltage constant from utils in Case 0 and Case 1 instead of redefining them in config.py and models.py.

- ~~Confirm that Case 1 breaks on long scale~~
