- see if we can solve r0r1t
    - idea: try more neurons in main net for linear case
        - might be saturation of activation function as well...
    - idea: see if we can find well-posed cases for ln





# Idea

- Try 0.5 and see if that can be used as quick-fix
- Go back and see if we can massage the numbers on the activation function
