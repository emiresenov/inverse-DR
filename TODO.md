# TODO

## Prio 1
- Make loglog versions for all cases

## Prio 2
- Come up with official reference solutions for all cases (?). Alternatively, propose a scaling method
- Case 3

## Prio 3
- Build eval for all cases
- Write a comprehensive report on the entire project


# Note
- Weighting was crucial for Case 1 loglog. It completely fails without it.
- The problem becomes more sensitive in loglog for all cases. 

## Perhaps going loglog is a bad idea.
- Proof: Case 1 starting weights. Change to [1,1,1] and it completely fails. Perhaps an argument against going loglog scale.
